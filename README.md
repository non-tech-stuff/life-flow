# life-flow


## Why
I observed that I did the same things everyday, so why not understand the process and automate it.
So I modeled the workflow of life, as of now.
Of course, it's not static.

## What
A simple workflow for life, for homo sapiens(at least).
I'm experimenting.
This is a simple workflow for living life.

## How
This is just a skeleton, it doesn't have any content.
A real working flow can be obtained, by plugging in:
1. Personal value system(preferably written by you)
2. Knowlege map
3. Goals
